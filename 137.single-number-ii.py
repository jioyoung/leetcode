# Testcase Example:  '[2,2,3,2]'
#
# Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except
# for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
# 
# Note:
# 
# Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
# it without using extra memory?
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,2,3,2]
# Output: 3
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
# Output: 99

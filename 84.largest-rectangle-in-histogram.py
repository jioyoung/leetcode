#
# Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where
# the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the
# histogram.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height =
# [2,1,5,6,2,3].
# 
# 
# 
# 
# The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10
# unit.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
# Output: 10

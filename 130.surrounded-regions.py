# Testcase Example:  '[["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]'
#
# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions
# surrounded by 'X'.
# 
# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded
# region.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X
# 
# 
# After running your function, the board should be:
# 
# 
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X
# 
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on
# the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the
# border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to
# 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected
# horizontally or vertically.

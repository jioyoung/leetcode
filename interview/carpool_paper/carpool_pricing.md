While ridesharing offers clear economic incentives to its participants (e.g., reduced operating cost, access to HOV lanes), it also negatively impacts travel experience, of which the loss of flexibility, convenience and privacy is frequently cited. Other issues include the limited pool of peers with which one can share a ride, and the challenge to split the cost fairly.

The difference between the two is twofold. First, drivers take part in carpool to fulfill their own travel needs, whereas drivers for ride pool do it as a mobility service provider. Second, carpool is arranged ahead of time whereas ridepool typically occurs in real-time. The focus of this study is carpool.

However, bringing together a large number of riders and drivers also creates its own challenge: how to match them in a fair and efficient way that promotes participation in carpool? At the heart of this challenge lie two problems: the pricing problem and the matching/routing/scheduling problem. The latter is closely related to the multi-vehicle pickup and delivery problem, which has been extensively studied in the literature. The pricing problem, having received relatively less attention, is the subject of this paper.

Unlike ridepool drivers, a carpool driver does not earn a wage for her labor. Instead, she
is compensated for the extra effort incurred when sharing a ride with others. Hence, a desired
compensation depends on how the driver values this extra effort, and with whom she is matched.
Similarly, the price a rider is willing to pay also varies with the matching partner and her private
valuation of the shared ride.

Because carpool relies on voluntary participation, it is essential that the service is such priced that both riders and drivers are satisfied. To determine satisfaction, one needs to know how participants value their shared rides, and the most common mechanism to
elicit this information is double auction. If a carpool platform prices rides by auction, participants will be asked to report, among other things, how much they value the trip. Upon receiving these "bids‚Äù, the platform decides (1) matched pairs (the winners of the auction); and (2) the price for each rider and the payment to each driver. Ideally, these decisions should ensure that 
(1) IR: all participants are satisfied (referred to as Individual Rationality, or IR), 
(2) IC: no participant has incentive to misreport her trip value (referred to as Individual Compatibility, or IC), 
(3) AE: the social welfare is maximized (referred to as Allocative Efficiency, or AE), 
(4) BB: the platform is at least revenue neutral (referred to as budget balance, BB). It is well known that no pricing policy can simultaneously satisfy IR, IC, AE and BB. Hence, the key is the tradeoff between these conflicting properties.

Second, $b^l$ directly affects how much detour a driver is willing to accept and how much a rider
is willing to pay for a shared ride. Hence, it can drive the matching and pricing decisions of the
platform.

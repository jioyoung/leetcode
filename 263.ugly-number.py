#
# Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
# 
# Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 6
# Output: true
# Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 8
# Output: true
# Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: 14
# Output: false 
# Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
# Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1].

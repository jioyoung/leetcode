# Testcase Example:  '[2,3,1,1,4]'
#
# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the
# first index of the array.
# 
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that
# position.
# 
# Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its
# maximum
# jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
#

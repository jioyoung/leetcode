#
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
# to you beforehand.
# 
# (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
# 
# You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its
# index, otherwise return -1.
# 
# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
# 
# Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: 4
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: -1
#
